# CameLigo Hello World

This is a simple CameLigo contract that shows the basic structure of a Tezos smart contract - the way entrypoints are defined, and the way the `main` function operates.

The `.sh` files are posix shell scripts that show the basic usage of the `ligo` compiler and `tezos-client` for building and installing the contract.

This repository also serves as the starting ground for CameLigo coding exercises.
